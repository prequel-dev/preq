      title: RabbitMQ Mnesia overloaded recovering persistent queues
      category: message-queue-problems
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        - The RabbitMQ cluster is processing a large number of persistent mirrored queues at boot.
      cause: |
        - The Erlang process, Mnesia, is overloaded while recovering persistent queues on boot.
      impact: |
        - RabbitMQ is unable to process any new messages and can cause outages in consumers and producers.
      tags:
        - known-problem
        - rabbitmq
      mitigation: |
        - Adjusting mirroring policies to limit the number of mirrored queues
        - Remove high-availability policies from queues
        - Add additional CPU resources and restart the RabbitMQ cluster
        - Use [lazy queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/lazy-queues) to avoid incurring the costs of writing data to disk
